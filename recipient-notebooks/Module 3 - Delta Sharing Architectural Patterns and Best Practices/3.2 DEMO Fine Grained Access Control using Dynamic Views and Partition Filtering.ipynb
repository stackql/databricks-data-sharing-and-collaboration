        "   - Follow privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)\n",

        "3. **Cache Appropriately**\n",
        "   - Cache aggregated results, not raw PII\n",

        "   - Honor data retention policies\n",

        "4. **Document Limitations**\n",
        "   - Document which analyses are possible with your access level\n",

        "   - Track data lineage\n",

        "   - Validate completeness within your scope\n",
        "   - Report issues to provider\n",

        "✅ **Row-Level Security**: Regional partners saw only their geographic data\n",
        "✅ **Column-Level Masking**: Marketing agencies saw masked PII\n",
        "✅ **Data Anonymization**: Risk analysts saw financial data without identity\n",
        "✅ **Full Access Control**: Compliance auditors saw complete data\n",
        "✅ **Partition Filtering**: Storage-level restrictions prevented unauthorized access\n",
        "✅ **Dynamic Views**: Same source data, different recipient experiences\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Flexible Security**: One dataset can serve multiple use cases securely\n",
        "2. **Automatic Enforcement**: Access controls apply automatically at query time\n",
        "3. **No Data Duplication**: Provider maintains single source of truth\n",
        "4. **Privacy by Design**: Sensitive data never leaves provider's control\n",
        "5. **Recipient Transparency**: Recipients understand their access level\n",
        "6. **Compliance Ready**: Supports regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)\n",

        "**Healthcare**: Share patient data with researchers (anonymized) and providers (full PII)\n",
