    "## Overview\n",
    "In this demo, we will implement Delta Sharing to securely share data between Databricks workspaces. This demonstration is split into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provider Notebook:** We will create a Unity Catalog with sample customer and sales data, configure Delta Sharing by creating a share, set up a recipient organization, and generate an activation link for secure access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recipient Notebook (This Notebook):** The receiving organization (using Databricks) will mount the share in a local catalog and query the shared tables directly without copying data, and perform analytics using the shared datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo showcases the Databricks-to-Databricks (D2D) sharing pattern, where both the provider and recipient use Databricks workspaces. You'll see how Delta Sharing enables secure, live data sharing without data duplication or complex ETL processes."

    "âœ… **What we accomplished:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activated a Delta Share using the activation link\n",
    "2. Created a catalog in our workspace from the share\n",
    "3. Explored the shared schemas and tables\n",
    "4. Queried shared data with full SQL capabilities\n",
    "5. Performed analytical queries joining shared tables\n",
    "6. Created local views based on shared data\n",
    "7. Understood recipient limitations (read-only access)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- ðŸš€ **No Data Copying**: Query data directly from the provider\n",
    "- ðŸ”’ **Secure**: Provider controls access and can revoke at any time\n",
    "- âš¡ **Real-time**: Always access the latest data from the provider\n",
    "- ðŸ’° **Cost-effective**: No storage costs for recipients\n",
    "- ðŸ”§ **Standard SQL**: Use familiar SQL syntax for queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Activation**: One-time process to accept a share\n",
    "- **Read-only Access**: Recipients can query but not modify shared data\n",
    "- **Live Data**: Changes in provider tables are immediately visible\n",
    "- **Local Materialization**: Recipients can create local copies if needed"
